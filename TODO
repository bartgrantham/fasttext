= Documentation ====

-- webserver config examples
    - lighty
    - mongrel (and mongrel2?)
    - nginx
    - apache2


= Code fixes, Features ====

-- Cache-Control header (or maybe this is best handled by the webserver?)

-- reenable rotation

-- help=...
    - "usage" - Fix text
    - "fonts"
    - "debug" & "textdebug"
    - "limits"

-- any help/debugging screen should have an ISO-8601 timestamp to clue in a dev to possible caching problems

-- Environment vars
    - ALLOW_DEBUG
    - EXTRA_HEADERS
    - DEFAULT_FONT = "..."

-- How to handle newlines correctly? (this is a problem for help texts and user texts)

-- should I build a: FT_Face * guessfont(const char * family, const char * style) - would probably need faces_byfile, faces_byfamily, faces_bystyle

-- stderr doesn't exist until FCGI_Accept() is called the first time, so how do I provide startup logging?  Or is this just a lighty problem?


= Rendering enhancements ====

-- Immediate
    Start using the Cairo "scaled font" API: http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-scaled-font-t.html
    Would libpng be faster than cairo's png handling?  Doesn't Cairo just use libpng?  At least I would have greater control over speed/size tradeoff.
    Support for gif or jpg might be worthwhile, if for no other reason than speed.

-- Long-term:
    Convert to Pango, the "real" text API in Cairo: http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/unstable/
    ... or Convert to GD:
